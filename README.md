About Dizzy-Hotpink-Capybara

The Dizzy-Hotpink-Capybara project draws inspiration from the angry-purple-tiger project by Helium. Originally written in Rust, angry-purple-tiger is a lightweight and efficient hostname generator that combines an adjective, a color, and an animal to produce unique, human-readable names. This naming convention has been widely used in Helium's ecosystem for identifying hotspots and devices.

Dizzy-Hotpink-Capybara is a rebuild of angry-purple-tiger in Go, designed to offer similar functionality while introducing additional features and customization options:
Key Differences and Enhancements

    Language:
        The original project was written in Rust, while this version is implemented in Go for broader compatibility and integration with Go-based ecosystems.

    Customizability:
        Easily extend or modify word lists (adjectives, colors, animals) without changing core logic.

    Performance and Simplicity:
        While Rust excels in performance, Go's concurrency model and simplicity make it an ideal choice for scalable, maintainable backend tools.
